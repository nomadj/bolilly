## BoLilly Live

Welcome to BoLilly Live! Bo is a career musician and web3 dev who builds necessary things that don't exist. 

This is a great dapp template for independent musicians. Live stream, archive recordings, document achievements, build a press kit, and perfectly control access to your content while maintaining 100% ownership. Accept any EVM compatible currency, create your own currency, and tokenize your content.

## The Web3 Checklist

Remember that web3 bears far more permanence than web2. Imagine your first MySpace profile, and every comment you've ever posted, and every site you've ever visited, now a part of your permanent, public profile. Here is a mental checklist one should perform every time before tokenizing a piece of data:

	 1) Am I okay with friends, family, and coworkers seeing this?
	 2) Will I still be okay with friends, family, and coworkers seeing this 80 years from now?
	 3) Could the data close a proverbial door to opportunity, now or in the future?
	 4) Does the data contain identifiers or imply affiliation with another entity?
	 5) If so, how will they feel about this, now and far all of perpetuity?
	 6) How do I feel about any implied affiliation, and will that feeling ever change?
	 7) Is this moral and legal, now and forevermore?
